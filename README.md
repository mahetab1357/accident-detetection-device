Smart Accident Detection and Notification System

This project is an innovative IoT-based safety solution designed to detect accidents and provide real-time notifications to emergency contacts. It is tailored for motorcyclists and cyclists, focusing on enhancing road safety through intelligent automation.

The system works by integrating accelerometers to detect abnormal movements or impacts that indicate a possible accident. Upon detection, a buzzer is triggered to alert the rider. If the buzzer is not turned off within a specified time frame, the system assumes the rider is incapacitated. It then sends an emergency notification, including the riderâ€™s precise GPS location, to pre-configured contacts or emergency services using a GSM module.

Features:
Accident Detection: Monitors for sudden movements or impacts using accelerometers.
Rider Alert: Triggers a buzzer to alert the rider after an accident is detected.
Emergency Notification: Automatically sends GPS location data to emergency contacts if the alert is not acknowledged.
Real-Time GPS Tracking: Integrates GPS for accurate location data.
Compact and Portable: Lightweight design ideal for mounting on bikes or helmets.
Scalable and Customizable: Easily adaptable for additional features like health monitoring or weather alerts.

Technologies Used:
Hardware: Arduino, Accelerometer, GPS module, GSM module, Buzzer.
Software: Arduino IDE for programming, SMS Gateway for notifications.
This project ensures rapid response during accidents, potentially saving lives by reducing the time it takes for emergency services to reach the scene. It is a practical, scalable, and efficient solution for enhancing safety on the roads.
